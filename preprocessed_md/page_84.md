## NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to Interim consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Corporation intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of tax regulations. However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination depends on the results of the tax authorities’ examinations.

Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
