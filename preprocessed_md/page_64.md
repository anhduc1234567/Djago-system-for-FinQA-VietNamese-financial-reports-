## REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**To:**  
Shareholders  
The Boards of Directors and Management  
PetroVietnam Gas Joint Stock Corporation

We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of PetroVietnam Gas Joint Stock Corporation (the "Corporation"), prepared on 12 August 2025 as set out from page 05 to page 58, which comprise the interim consolidated balance sheet as of 30 June 2025, the interim consolidated statement of income and interim consolidated statement of cash flows for the 6-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

### The Board of Management’s Responsibility for the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating to interim consolidated financial reporting, and for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

### Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements (VSRE) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.

A review of interim consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
