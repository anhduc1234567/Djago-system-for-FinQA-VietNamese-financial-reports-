### Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of materials, tools and supplies, and merchandise comprises purchase costs and other directly attributable expenses. Cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method for external purchased LPG and the weighted average method for the others. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

The Corporation applies perpetual method to account for inventories.

The evaluation of necessary provision for inventory obsolescence follows current prevailing accounting regulations which allow provisions to be made for obsolete, damaged, or sub-standard inventories and for those which have costs higher than net realizable value as at the end of the accounting period.

### Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

The costs of purchased tangible fixed assets comprise their purchase prices and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to their working conditions and locations for their intended use. The costs of self-constructed or manufactured assets are the actual construction or manufacturing cost plus installation and test running costs.

The costs of tangible fixed assets formed from construction investment by contractual mode or self-construction or self-generating process are the settled costs of the invested construction projects in accordance with the prevailing State’s regulations on investment and construction management, directly related expenses and registration fee (if any). In the event the construction project has been completed and put into use but the settled costs thereof have not been approved, the cost of tangible fixed assets is recognised at the estimated cost based on the actual cost incurred. The estimated cost will be adjusted according to the settled costs approved by the Board of Directors or the Board of Management based on decentralization of authority.

Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, details are as follows:

| Asset                                                     | Years   |
