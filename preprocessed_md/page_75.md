## NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

### Basis of consolidation

The interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the interim financial statements of the Corporation and enterprises controlled by the Corporation (its subsidiaries) for the 6-month period ended 30 June 2025. Control is achieved where the Corporation has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the interim consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Corporation.

Intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those non-controlling interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses in subsidiaries are respectively attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

### Business combinations

On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to consolidated profit and loss in the period of acquisition.

The non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders' proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

### Investments in associates

An associate is an entity over which the Corporation has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control over those policies.

The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these interim consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Interests in associates are carried in the interim consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Corporation’s share of the net assets of the associate. Losses of an associate in excess of the Corporation’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Corporation’s net investment in the associate) are not recognised, unless the Corporation is obliged to make payments on behalf of the associate for debts that the Corporation has guaranteed and committed to pay. If the associate is subsequently profitable, the Corporation shall only recognize its share of such profit after the previously unrecognized net loss has been offset.
