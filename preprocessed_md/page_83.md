## NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

- Items of the interim income statement and the interim cash flow statement are translated into VND at the average exchange rate of the period. In case there is a significant change in the exchange rate in the period, the actual transaction rates at the dates of the transactions will be applied. In case the average exchange rate of the accounting period is approximate to the actual transaction rate at the dates of the transactions (the difference does not exceed 2%), the applied exchange rate is the average exchange rate. In case the amplitude fluctuation of the exchange rate at the opening period and the closing period excesses 20%, the applied exchange rate is the closing exchange rate.

- Exchange differences arising on the translation of the interim financial statements prepared in foreign currency into VND are presented in the "Foreign exchange reserve" item with the code 417 under the "Equity" section in the Interim consolidated balance sheet or in the Interim consolidated income statement for the period when the Corporation no longer has controls and/or significant influence over the investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

- As of 30 June 2025, balance of item "Foreign exchange reserve" in the Corporation's interim consolidated balance sheet represents gain from translating financial statements presented in foreign currencies.

### Borrowing costs

- Borrowing costs are recognised in the interim consolidated income statement in the period when incurred unless they are capitalised in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 16 "Borrowing costs". Accordingly, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost/original cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the cost/original cost of those assets. For specific borrowings for the purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties, borrowing costs are capitalised even when the construction period is under 12 months.

### Taxation

- Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

- The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the interim consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.

- Deferred tax is recognised on significant differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Interim consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
